PHASE 2 INDIVIDUAL ANIMAL TRAJECTORIES: INTERPRETATION GUIDE
================================================================================

WHAT THE FIGURE SHOWS
================================================================================

Each panel represents ONE ANIMAL'S Phase 2 reversal learning trajectory.

Visual Elements:
1. COLORED BARS (bottom): The STATE each trial was classified into
   • Blue bar = Trial in ENGAGED state (high engagement, good decisions)
   • Orange bar = Trial in BIASED state (perseverative/biased choices)
   • Red bar = Trial in LAPSED state (disengaged, random choices)

2. BLACK LINE WITH DOTS: The ACCURACY during each trial
   • Vertical position = % correct choices within that state
   • Goes from 0% (bottom) to 100% (top)
   • Connected line shows how accuracy changes over the session

3. TEXT BOX (upper left): Summary statistics
   • State Occupancy: % of trials spent in each state
   • State Accuracy: % correct choices while in each state


WHAT THESE METRICS MEAN
================================================================================

STATE OCCUPANCY (e.g., "Engaged: 35%")
→ The animal spent 35% of Phase 2 trials in the Engaged state
→ This is about DISTRIBUTION OF TIME across states
→ Example: If 800 trials total, 280 were in Engaged state

ACCURACY (e.g., "Engaged: 72.3%")
→ While in Engaged state, the animal chose correctly 72.3% of the time
→ This is about DECISION-MAKING QUALITY within that state
→ Example: In 280 Engaged trials, correct on ~203 trials

COMBINED INTERPRETATION:
→ High Occupancy + High Accuracy = Adaptive state (good for task)
→ Low Occupancy + High Accuracy = Underutilized strength
→ High Occupancy + Low Accuracy = Maladaptive strategy
→ Low Occupancy + Low Accuracy = Irrelevant state


WHAT EACH STATE REPRESENTS
================================================================================

ENGAGED STATE (Blue):
• Animal shows high engagement with task
• Responsive to task contingencies
• Makes deliberate decisions, not random
• Usually shows elevated accuracy
• Indicator of learning and performance

BIASED STATE (Orange):
• Animal shows perseverative or biased choices
• Examples: Always chooses left, always repeats previous choice
• Not random, but not task-adaptive
• Accuracy varies but often medium
• Can indicate stereotyped responding or learning a wrong rule

LAPSED STATE (Red):
• Animal is disengaged, has "given up"
• Choices are near-random or completely random
• Accuracy low (around 50% or chance level)
• Indicates loss of engagement or learning failure
• Problematic for task performance


LEARNING PATTERNS TO LOOK FOR
================================================================================

ADAPTIVE LEARNING (like B6):
→ Early phase: Mixed states, variable accuracy
→ Late phase: Increased Engaged occupancy, high Engaged accuracy
→ Lapsed occupancy decreases over time
→ Overall trajectory: Learning to engage more, disengage less
→ Result: High overall accuracy by end of session

ALTERNATIVE LEARNING (like C3H×B6):
→ Increased reliance on Biased state (stereotyped but consistent)
→ Lapsed state decreases significantly
→ Not perfectly adaptive but functional
→ Result: Medium-high accuracy through consistent strategy

MALADAPTIVE LEARNING (like A1D_Wt):
→ Early phase: Tries multiple states
→ Late phase: Increases Lapsed state, decreases Biased state
→ Gives up on task over time
→ Result: Low overall accuracy, declining performance

OSCILLATORY LEARNING (like A1D_KO):
→ Alternates between states without clear pattern
→ High variability in state sequence
→ Mixed state dominance
→ Result: Medium accuracy but inconsistent pattern

NON-LEARNING (like A1D_Het):
→ No clear progression through states
→ Random-looking state sequence
→ Inconsistent accuracy across time
→ Result: Low, variable performance


HOW TO READ SPECIFIC ANIMALS
================================================================================

Example 1: B6 Animal (Adaptive)
Panel shows:
  - Many blue bars early and late → Engaged throughout
  - Accuracy line stays high (70-80% range)
  - Few red bars → Minimal lapse
  - Interpretation: "This animal learned the reversal effectively by staying engaged"

Example 2: A1D_Wt Animal (Maladaptive)
Panel shows:
  - Orange bars (Biased) → Relying on stereotyped choice
  - Accuracy declining over time (starts 60%, ends 40%)
  - Increasing red bars (Lapsed) toward end
  - Interpretation: "This animal started with a strategy but gave up, ending lapsed"

Example 3: A1D_KO Animal (Mixed)
Panel shows:
  - Alternating colors → Switching between states
  - Accuracy fluctuating with state changes
  - No clear trend in state sequence
  - Interpretation: "This animal doesn't settle on a strategy, oscillates constantly"


CONNECTING TO REGRESSION ANALYSIS
================================================================================

The learning rates from the regression analysis panel showed:

B6: +0.0257% Engaged per 100 trials ***
→ This animal's panel should show INCREASING blue dominance over trials

A1D_Wt: -0.1107% Biased per 100 trials ***
→ This animal's panel should show DECREASING orange over trials
A1D_Wt: +0.1195% Lapsed per 100 trials
→ This animal's panel should show INCREASING red toward end of session

A1D_KO: +0.0416% Biased per 100 trials *
→ This animal's panel should show INCREASING orange relative to others


WHAT GENOTYPES TELL US
================================================================================

B6 - ADAPTIVE LEARNER
Exemplars show: Clear engagement trajectory, decreasing lapse
Learning strategy: Master task by staying engaged
Phase 2 success: HIGH (transitions to correctness efficiently)

C3H×B6 - SCAFFOLD LEARNER
Exemplars show: Early biased phase, then lapse suppression
Learning strategy: Use bias to maintain engagement, avoid lapse
Phase 2 success: HIGH (functional despite alternative path)

A1D_KO - OSCILLATOR
Exemplars show: Mixed state dominance, variable patterns
Learning strategy: None clear - alternates between approaches
Phase 2 success: MEDIUM (some compensatory engagement)

A1D_Het - NON-LEARNER
Exemplars show: Random-appearing state sequences
Learning strategy: None apparent
Phase 2 success: LOW (unable to consolidate learning)

A1D_Wt - MALADAPTIVE
Exemplars show: Disengagement over time, increasing lapse
Learning strategy: Attempted (some biased state use) but failed
Phase 2 success: LOWEST (progressive deterioration)


TECHNICAL NOTES
================================================================================

State Classification Method:
- Hidden Markov Model (GLM-HMM) identifies most likely state per trial
- Based on choices, outcomes, and state transition probabilities
- Probabilistic inference, not deterministic categorization

Accuracy Calculation:
- "during_accuracy" = P(correct choice | animal in this state)
- Computed within state-specific trial bouts
- Reflects decision quality conditioned on state

Trial Binning:
- Raw trials colored by inferred state
- State changes marked by color transitions
- Bout length determines how many trials share same color
