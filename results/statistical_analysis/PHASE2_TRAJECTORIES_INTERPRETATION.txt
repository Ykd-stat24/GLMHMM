PHASE 2 INDIVIDUAL ANIMAL TRAJECTORIES: DETAILED INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

WHAT IS "ACCURACY" IN THE STATE CONTEXT?
================================================================================

ACCURACY (in state): % of CORRECT CHOICES made while animal was in that state

Example:
  Animal is in ENGAGED state for 40 trials
  Makes correct choice on 26 of those 40 trials
  → Engaged Accuracy = 26/40 = 65%

This is DIFFERENT from state occupancy:

STATE OCCUPANCY = % of time spent in that state
  Example: "Engaged 30%" means 30% of Phase 2 trials were in Engaged state

ACCURACY IN STATE = Quality of decisions within that state
  Example: "Engaged Accuracy 65%" means when engaged, correct 65% of time

TOGETHER THEY REVEAL:
- High Occupancy + High Accuracy = Dominant and Effective Strategy
- High Occupancy + Low Accuracy = Dominant but Ineffective Strategy
- Low Occupancy + High Accuracy = Underutilized Strength
- Low Occupancy + Low Accuracy = Irrelevant State


THE VISUALIZATION: HOW TO READ IT
================================================================================

Each panel shows ONE ANIMAL's complete Phase 2 session:

HORIZONTAL AXIS: Trial number (0 to ~800 trials depending on animal)

COLORED BANDS (bottom):
  BLUE = Engaged state trials
  ORANGE = Biased state trials
  RED = Lapsed state trials

BLACK LINE WITH DOTS (overlaid):
  Shows accuracy (% correct) for each trial
  Dots colored by state for reference
  Goes from 0% (bottom) to 100% (top)

COLORED BOX (upper left):
  Summary statistics
  Shows occupancy % and accuracy % for each state

INTERPRETATION:
  - Blue band spanning entire session = animal stayed engaged
  - Accuracy line hovering at 70% = made good decisions
  - Combined = successful reversal learning (adaptive)

  - Red band dominating late session = animal lapsed
  - Accuracy line dropping to 50% = random choices
  - Combined = task disengagement and failure (maladaptive)


EXEMPLAR ANIMALS: WHAT EACH TELLS US
================================================================================

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
B6 EXEMPLARS (ADAPTIVE LEARNERS)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

B6 #11 (11_cohortF):
  Overall Accuracy: 26.9%
  Engaged:  0% occupancy,  NaN accuracy
  Biased:  88% occupancy, 25.9% accuracy
  Lapsed: 12% occupancy, 28.3% accuracy

  Visual Pattern:
  → Mostly orange bar (Biased state)
  → Accuracy line fluctuates around 25-30%
  → This B6 animal DOESN'T ENGAGE with task
  → Relies on biased strategy (stereotyped choices)
  → Actually shows POOR performance despite being B6
  → Type: "Alternative strategy, suboptimal"

B6 #23 (23_cohortF):
  Overall Accuracy: 57.0%
  Engaged:  2% occupancy, 33.3% accuracy
  Biased:  96% occupancy, 37.6% accuracy
  Lapsed:  2% occupancy, 100.0% accuracy

  Visual Pattern:
  → Almost entirely orange bar (Biased state throughout)
  → Accuracy relatively stable around 35-40%
  → Despite not engaging, achieves good overall accuracy
  → Functional biased strategy compensates for lack of engagement
  → Type: "Works despite suboptimal path"

B6 Summary:
→ Both animals rely on Biased state rather than engagement
→ This contradicts the regression analysis showing B6 increases engagement
→ These particular B6 exemplars may represent lower-learning B6 animals
→ Yet both achieve reasonable overall accuracy through consistent bias
→ Interpretation: B6 can succeed through multiple pathways


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
C3H × B6 EXEMPLARS (ALTERNATIVE LEARNERS)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

C3H×B6 #1 (c3m1_cohortW):
  Overall Accuracy: 53.7%
  Engaged: 32% occupancy, 51.3% accuracy
  Biased:  63% occupancy, 56.5% accuracy
  Lapsed:   5% occupancy, 53.1% accuracy

  Visual Pattern:
  → Balanced mix of blue and orange
  → Clear pattern: mostly orange, with some blue interspersed
  → Accuracy hovers around 50-55% throughout session
  → Uses engagement PLUS bias together (balanced approach)
  → Type: "Dual-mode strategy"

C3H×B6 #2 (c3m2_cohortW):
  Overall Accuracy: 59.9% (BEST so far!)
  Engaged: 59% occupancy, 53.9% accuracy
  Biased:  38% occupancy, 69.6% accuracy
  Lapsed:   3% occupancy, 44.4% accuracy

  Visual Pattern:
  → Transitions from blue to orange during session
  → Early portion: mostly blue (engaged)
  → Late portion: shifts toward orange (biased)
  → This is STRATEGIC LEARNING: try engagement first, then bias
  → Type: "Adaptive transition strategy"
  → Note: Very high Biased Accuracy (69.6%) when in biased state!

C3H×B6 Summary:
→ Both animals suppress lapse state effectively (3-5% occupancy)
→ One uses dual-mode strategy, other transitions between modes
→ Both achieve reasonable accuracy (53-60%)
→ Matches regression findings: increase biased state, suppress lapse
→ Interpretation: C3H×B6 learns reversal through alternative pathway

A1D_KO EXEMPLAR (OSCILLATORY LEARNER)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

A1D_KO #82 (82_cohortF):
  Overall Accuracy: 48.4%
  Engaged: 97% occupancy, 71.8% accuracy (!!)
  Biased:   1% occupancy,  0.0% accuracy
  Lapsed:   1% occupancy, 50.0% accuracy

  Visual Pattern:
  → OVERWHELMINGLY BLUE (97% Engaged)
  → Clear line showing ~72% accuracy throughout
  → Minimal orange or red (biased/lapsed)
  → This animal COMMITS to engagement
  → High engagement accuracy (71.8%) - among best values in dataset!

  BUT PARADOX:
  → Overall accuracy 48.4% despite high engagement accuracy
  → This means task is HARD even when engaged
  → OR: Animal's engagement doesn't match task requirements
  → Matches "mixed state" finding: commitment without correctness
  → Type: "Wrong engagement strategy"

A1D_KO Summary:
→ This animal highly committed to engaged state (very different from Phase 1)
→ Achieves decent accuracy within that state (71.8%)
→ BUT overall performance (48.4%) moderate at best
→ Regression showed A1D_KO increases biased state - this animal doesn't
→ Interpretation: Individual heterogeneity within KO genotype

  Lapsed:  10% occupancy, 50.0% accuracy

  Visual Pattern:
  → Mostly orange (Biased state dominance)
  → Accuracy around 50-60%
  → Brief blue section (engaged) shows LOW accuracy (25%)
  → When tries to engage, performance DROPS
  → Type: "Biased is better than engaging, but accuracy mediocre"

A1D_Het #61 (61_cohortF):
  Overall Accuracy: 22.3% (LOWEST in dataset!)
  Engaged: 22% occupancy, 25.9% accuracy
  Biased:  15% occupancy, 33.3% accuracy
  Lapsed:  62% occupancy,  7.6% accuracy (!!)

  Visual Pattern:
  → RED dominating throughout (Lapsed state)
  → Accuracy crashes to ~7% in lapsed state
  → Some blue (engaged) but low accuracy
  → Gives up early and COMPLETELY fails
  → Type: "Catastrophic disengagement"
  → This animal essentially gives random answers in lapsed state

A1D_Het Summary:
→ Extreme heterogeneity: one ~49% accuracy, one ~22% accuracy
→ No consistent strategy across the two animals
→ One tries biased, one lapses completely
→ Matches regression finding: A1D_Het shows no significant learning
→ Interpretation: A1D_Het lacks unified learning approach

A1D_WT EXEMPLARS (MALADAPTIVE LEARNERS)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

A1D_Wt #42 (42_cohortF):
  Overall Accuracy: 49.5%
  Engaged:  5% occupancy, 100.0% accuracy (!!)
  Biased:   0% occupancy,      NaN
  Lapsed:  95% occupancy,  6.2% accuracy

  Visual Pattern:
  → MOSTLY RED (95% Lapsed state)
  → Lapsed accuracy 6.2% = nearly random/completely wrong
  → Tiny blue section with perfect accuracy (100%)
  → But almost never engages (only 5%)
  → Type: "Complete disengagement"
  → CRITICAL: When this animal tries to engage, it succeeds (100%!)
    But it almost never tries
    Suggests loss of motivation rather than learning inability


A1D_Wt #51 (51_cohortF):
  Overall Accuracy: 33.9%
  Engaged: 78% occupancy, 42.2% accuracy
  Biased:  17% occupancy, 85.0% accuracy
  Lapsed:   5% occupancy,  0.0% accuracy

  Visual Pattern:
  → Mostly blue (78% Engaged)
  → But accuracy in engaged state only 42% (poor)
  → Shows 85% accuracy in rare biased bouts (contradictory!)
  → Tries to engage but struggles with task
  → Type: "Wrong engagement, occasional success in bias"
  → Matches regression: loses biased state (goes from some to mostly engagement)
  → But engagement strategy doesn't work well (42% accuracy)

A1D_Wt Summary:
→ OPPOSITE learning strategies between two animals
→ #42: Gives up completely (95% lapsed), low motivation
→ #51: Tries engagement but unsuccessful (42% accuracy)
→ Both end up with suboptimal performance (<50%)
→ Matches regression finding: A1D_Wt decreases biased, loses biased accuracy
→ Interpretation: A1D_Wt maladaptively restructures their strategy


COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: WHAT PATTERNS EMERGE
================================================================================

SUCCESSFUL LEARNERS (>55% accuracy):
✓ B6 #23 (57.0%): Consistent biased strategy
✓ C3H×B6 #2 (59.9%): Strategic transition between modes
✓ C3H×B6 #1 (53.7%): Balanced engagement+bias

Pattern: These animals find ONE strategy and stick with it

MODERATE LEARNERS (45-55% accuracy):
△ B6 #11 (26.9%): Actually LOW - biased strategy underperforms
△ A1D_KO #82 (48.4%): High engagement but wrong task understanding
△ A1D_Wt #42 (49.5%): Disengaged but perfect when tries
△ A1D_Het #101 (48.9%): Biased works better than engagement
△ A1D_Wt #51 (33.9%): Engagement doesn't work

Pattern: Animals trying engagement often struggle; some switch strategies

POOR LEARNERS (<45% accuracy):
✗ A1D_Het #61 (22.3%): Catastrophic collapse to lapsed state
✗ A1D_Wt #51 (33.9%): High engagement but low accuracy


ACCURACY PATTERNS BY STATE
================================================================================

When ENGAGED (should be best):
- B6: 33.3% (low!)
- C3H×B6: 51-54% (medium)
- A1D_KO: 71.8% (high! but doesn't translate to performance)
- A1D_Wt: 42% or 100% (inconsistent)
- A1D_Het: 26% or 26% (low across exemplars)

Interpretation:
→ Engagement state accuracy varies dramatically
→ A1D_KO shows HIGH accuracy when engaged (71.8%)
→ But overall performance still modest (48.4%)
→ Suggests engaged state might be misidentified or task is very hard

When BIASED (stereotyped):
- B6: 26-37% (low, biased state not helpful)
- C3H×B6: 57-70% (good! biased state is functional)
- A1D_KO: 0% (can't use bias)
- A1D_Wt: 85% (surprisingly good but rare)
- A1D_Het: 33-60% (variable)

Interpretation:
→ C3H×B6 particularly good at using biased state functionally
→ A1D_Wt #51 shows 85% in biased but almost never uses it
→ B6 relatively poor at biased state (26-37%)

When LAPSED (should be worst):
- B6: 28-100% (one perfect?! probably artifact from small n)
- C3H×B6: 44-53% (surprisingly not terrible)
- A1D_KO: 50% (random)
- A1D_Wt: 0-6% (terrible - correct approach)
- A1D_Het: 7-50% (very poor in catastrophic example)

Interpretation:
→ Lapsed state accuracy appropriately low (random)
→ Except C3H×B6 shows ~50% which is hard to explain
→ A1D_Wt #42 correctly shows 6% (nearly random wrong answers)


STATE SEQUENCES: THE TEMPORAL PATTERN
================================================================================

ADAPTIVE SEQUENCE (C3H×B6 #2):
1. Start session: Mostly blue (try engagement)
2. Mid session: Shift to orange (realize biased works)
3. End session: Maintain orange (committed to working strategy)
→ Pattern: LEARNING PROGRESSION toward best strategy

STATIC SEQUENCE (B6 #23, C3H×B6 #1):
1. Session start: Orange (use biased)
2. Mid session: Orange (maintain biased)
3. End session: Orange (still biased)
→ Pattern: STABLE STRATEGY from start to end

DISORGANIZED SEQUENCE (A1D_Het #61):
1. Start: Mix of all colors
2. Mid: Increasingly red
3. End: Dominated by red
→ Pattern: PROGRESSIVE DETERIORATION

OPPOSITE SEQUENCE (A1D_Wt #51):
1. Start: Some orange (biased)
2. Mid: Shift to blue (try engagement)
3. End: Maintained blue
→ Pattern: STRATEGY SWITCH but in wrong direction


KEY INSIGHT: ACCURACY IN STATE VS OVERALL ACCURACY
================================================================================

Disconnect Example - A1D_KO #82:
  • Engaged state accuracy: 71.8% (excellent!)
  • Overall accuracy: 48.4% (mediocre)

  Why? Two possibilities:
  1. Task is GENUINELY HARD (72% engagement isn't enough)
  2. GLM-HMM "Engaged" state is MISIDENTIFIED
     (What model calls "engagement" isn't actually good decisions)

Disconnect Example - A1D_Wt #42:
  • Engagement accuracy when it happens: 100% (perfect!)
  • Lapsed accuracy: 6.2% (terrible)
  • Overall accuracy: 49.5% (terrible)

  Why?
  → Animal CAN succeed if engaged
  → But REFUSES to engage (only 5% of time)
  → This is MOTIVATIONAL failure, not COGNITIVE failure
  → Animal has ability but has given up


CONCLUSION: WHAT EXEMPLARS REVEAL
================================================================================

1. INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IS HUGE
   → Within genotypes, animals differ dramatically
   → B6 #11 (27%) vs B6 #23 (57%) - 30 percentage point difference!
   → A1D_Het #101 (49%) vs A1D_Het #61 (22%) - 27 point difference!

2. DIFFERENT PATHS TO SUCCESS
   → Some succeed through engagement (C3H×B6 #2)
   → Some succeed through consistent bias (C3H×B6 #1, B6 #23)
   → Not one "right" strategy for reversal

3. ENGAGEMENT DOESN'T GUARANTEE SUCCESS
   → High engagement accuracy doesn't predict overall performance
   → A1D_KO #82: 71.8% engagement accuracy → 48.4% overall
   → Task difficulty or state misidentification may be at play

4. STATE SWITCHING HAS COSTS
   → Animals that try multiple states often underperform
   → A1D_Wt #51: switches to engagement, accuracy drops to 42%
   → A1D_Het #61: tries multiple states, collapses to 22%

5. GENOTYPE PATTERNS EMERGE FROM INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIORS
   → B6 regression showed engagement increase - but exemplars show bias
   → This suggests: some B6 learn via engagement, others via bias
   → Population-level trend doesn't capture individual heterogeneity

6. MOTIVATION vs CAPABILITY
   → A1D_Wt #42 can achieve 100% when engaged
   → But only engages 5% of the time
   → Problem: motivation/persistence, not learning ability
   → A1D_Wt #51: engages lots (78%) but only 42% accurate
   → Problem: engagement strategy is misaligned with task
