DETAILED PANEL EXPLANATIONS
================================================================================

**PANELS 1-3: STATE OCCUPANCY OVER TRIALS**

Visual Elements:
- LIGHT COLORED CURVES (transparent): Individual animal trajectories
  * Each line = one animal's occupancy pattern over Phase 2 trials
  * Colored by genotype (A1D_Wt=Red, A1D_KO=Teal, B6=Blue, etc.)
  * Transparency shows all curves simultaneously

- BOLD COLORED LINES: Genotype-specific regression fits
  * Thick line = linear regression through all animals of that genotype
  * Slope represents learning rate (% per 100 trials)
  * Shows direction of change: upward = increasing, downward = decreasing

- SHADED REGIONS: 95% Confidence Intervals (CI)
  * Surrounding each regression line
  * Wider shading = more uncertainty in slope estimate
  * Narrower shading = more consistent learning across animals

Key Observations:
- ENGAGED STATE (Left): Most genotypes relatively flat except B6 (slopes upward)
  * B6 learns to increase engagement over trials
  * A1D_Het oscillates without clear trend
  * A1D_Wt essentially flat (no learning)

- BIASED STATE (Middle): Clear divergence between genotypes
  * A1D_Wt slopes DOWNWARD (loses biased state - maladaptive!)
  * A1D_KO slopes UPWARD slightly (enters biased state more)
  * B6 essentially flat
  * C3H×B6 slopes UPWARD (learns via bias)

- LAPSED STATE (Right): Consistent decrease across most genotypes
  * B6: Strong decrease (learning to avoid lapse)
  * C3H×B6: Strong decrease (efficient lapse suppression)
  * A1D_Wt: Slight increase (gets worse - more lapse)
  * A1D_KO: Slight decrease (learning to avoid lapse)
  * A1D_Het: No trend (doesn't learn to suppress lapse)

Interpretation Meaning:
- Wide CI around a steep slope = robust learning effect (even with individual variation)
- Wide CI around a flat slope = no clear learning (high individual heterogeneity)
- Wide CI + steep slope = some animals learn, others don't (check Panel 7-9!)
- Narrow CI + steep slope = consistent learning across all animals of that genotype


**PANEL 4: LEARNING RATE COMPARISON**

Visual Elements:
- BARS: Learning rate slopes (% change per 100 trials)
  * Positive bar = occupancy increases over trials
  * Negative bar = occupancy decreases over trials
  * Arranged by state (Engaged | Biased | Lapsed) then by genotype

- ERROR BARS: 95% Confidence Intervals
  * Vertical lines extending above/below each bar
  * If CI crosses zero = slope not significantly different from zero (n.s.)
  * If CI is entirely positive = significant increase (***/**/*)
  * If CI is entirely negative = significant decrease (***/**/*)

- SIGNIFICANCE ASTERISKS: p-value thresholds
  * *** = p < 0.001 (highly significant)
  * ** = p < 0.01 (very significant)
  * * = p < 0.05 (significant)
  * n.s. = p ≥ 0.05 (not significant)

Key Observations:

ENGAGED STATE (leftmost group):
  A1D_Het: -0.0634% [-0.2463, 0.1195] n.s. (flat, no learning)
  A1D_KO:  -0.0219% [-0.0655, 0.0217] n.s. (declining slightly, not significant)
  A1D_Wt:  -0.0088% [-0.1431, 0.1256] n.s. (flat, no learning)
  B6:      +0.0257% [+0.0125, +0.0388] *** (increases engagement!)
  C3H×B6:  +0.0062% [-0.0140, 0.0264] n.s. (barely increases, not significant)

→ Only B6 shows significant engagement learning

BIASED STATE (middle group):
  A1D_Het: +0.0319% [-0.1685, 0.2323] n.s. (no trend)
  A1D_KO:  +0.0416% [+0.0058, +0.0774] * (increases bias - significant!)
  A1D_Wt:  -0.1107% [-0.1677, -0.0537] *** (decreases bias - maladaptive!)
  B6:      -0.0048% [-0.0172, +0.0076] n.s. (no trend)
  C3H×B6:  +0.0228% [+0.0021, +0.0435] * (increases bias - significant!)

→ A1D_Wt deteriorates while A1D_KO and C3H×B6 learn via bias

LAPSED STATE (rightmost group):
  A1D_Het: +0.0315% [-0.1945, 0.2574] n.s. (no trend)
  A1D_KO:  -0.0197% [-0.0420, 0.0026] n.s. (decreases slightly, not significant)
  A1D_Wt:  +0.1195% [-0.0176, 0.2565] n.s. (increases lapse, effect size large but p=0.089)
  B6:      -0.0208% [-0.0348, -0.0069] ** (decreases lapse - adaptive!)
  C3H×B6:  -0.0290% [-0.0454, -0.0127] *** (decreases lapse - adaptive!)

→ B6 and C3H×B6 learn to suppress lapsing; A1D_Wt gets worse


**PANEL 5: STATISTICAL SUMMARY TABLE**

Displays all regression results in tabular format with:
- State: Engaged, Biased, or Lapsed
- Genotype: A1D_Het, A1D_KO, A1D_Wt, B6, C3H×B6
- Slope: Learning rate (% per 100 trials)
- 95% CI: Confidence interval bounds
- P-value: Statistical significance
- Significance: Visual marker (n.s., *, **, ***)
- R²: Variance explained by the linear regression
- N Bins: Number of trial bins analyzed

Reading Guide:
- Higher R² (e.g., 0.1660) = better fit, more consistent learning
- Lower R² (e.g., 0.0001) = poor fit, high variability in learning
- Narrow CI = stable learning pattern
- Wide CI = inconsistent learning across animals


**PANEL 6: EFFECT SIZE HEATMAP (R²)**

Visual Elements:
- ROWS: Genotypes (A1D_Het, A1D_KO, A1D_Wt, B6, C3H×B6)
- COLUMNS: States (Engaged, Biased, Lapsed)
- COLOR INTENSITY: R² value (higher = darker orange/red)
- CELL VALUES: R² number (0.0000 to 1.0000)

Interpretation:
- Dark red (R² > 0.10) = strong effect size, consistent learning pattern
- Light yellow (R² < 0.01) = weak effect size, high variability

Key Patterns:
- A1D_KO's BIASED state shows R²=0.1660 (darkest cell!) = very consistent learning
- A1D_Wt's BIASED state shows R²=0.0983 = fairly consistent but opposite direction
- Most cells are pale = low R² = learning rates vary by individual
- Takeaway: Genotypes show consistent DIRECTION of learning, but high individual variation


**PANELS 7-9: WITHIN-GENOTYPE VARIATION (Violin Plots)**

Visual Elements:
- VIOLIN SHAPE: Distribution of individual animal learning rates
  * Wide violin = high variation among animals
  * Narrow violin = consistent learning across animals
  * Height represents range of slopes

- RED DOTS INSIDE: Individual animal learning rate values
  * Each dot = one animal's slope for that state
  * Horizontal position jittered for visibility
  * Colored by genotype
  * Stacked vertically = multiple animals with similar slopes

- RED LINE (inside violin): Median learning rate
- GREEN LINE (inside violin): Mean learning rate

Key Observations:

ENGAGED STATE (Left):
- B6 (blue, rightmost): Dots clustered in positive region
  * All B6 animals increase engagement slightly
  * Very consistent pattern (narrow violin)

- A1D_Wt (red, second from left): Dots scattered around zero
  * Some animals increase, some decrease engagement
  * High variability (wide violin)
  * No consistent learning pattern

BIASED STATE (Middle):
- A1D_KO (teal): Dots cluster in positive region
  * Most KO animals increase bias during Phase 2
  * Consistent pattern despite small sample size

- A1D_Wt (red): Dots cluster in negative region
  * All or most Wt animals DECREASE bias
  * This is the maladaptive learning!
  * Biased towards giving up

LAPSED STATE (Right):
- B6 and C3H×B6: Dots cluster below zero
  * Both consistently decrease lapsing
  * Effective learning of reversal task

- A1D_Wt: Dots scattered around zero to positive
  * No consistent suppression of lapse
  * Some animals actually increase lapse
  * Learning failure

Interpretation:
- Narrow, concentrated violins = genotype-level strategy
  * All animals do the same thing
  * Strong genotypic signature

- Wide, spread violins = individual heterogeneity
  * Animals within genotype diverge
  * Possible subpopulations within genotype

COMPARATIVE INSIGHTS: WHAT THE ENHANCED FIGURE REVEALS
================================================================================

**Advantage 1: Confidence Intervals Show Certainty**

Original figure showed slopes without uncertainty.
Enhanced figure shows 95% CI around each slope.

Example: A1D_Wt Biased state
- Slope: -0.1107% per 100 trials
- CI: [-0.1677, -0.0537]
- Interpretation: Even accounting for uncertainty, this genotype RELIABLY
  decreases its biased state use during Phase 2.
- This is a robust, consistent finding, not random noise.

**Advantage 2: Individual Curves Show the Range**

Original figure showed only regression lines.
Enhanced figure overlays all individual animals' trajectories.

Example: B6 Engaged state
- The regression line slopes upward
- BUT the individual animal curves show:
  * Some animals increase engagement sharply
  * Some animals stay flat
  * Some animals even decrease slightly
  * The AVERAGE trend is upward, but individual variation exists
- This reveals that B6's "engagement learning" isn't universal,
  though the genotype-level pattern is consistent.

**Advantage 3: Violin Plots Show Consistency or Heterogeneity**

Original figure showed only aggregated statistics.
Enhanced figure shows distribution of individual learning rates.

Example: A1D_Wt Biased state
- All individual animals show NEGATIVE slope (learning to decrease bias)
- This is not a random scattering - it's a consistent genotype signature
- Wide range (-0.3 to +0.0) shows some animals learn more than others,
  but the direction is unanimously maladaptive.

**Advantage 4: Statistical Annotations Enable Interpretation**

Original figure showed slopes but required external reference.
Enhanced figure annotates significance levels directly on visualization.

Example: Comparing genotypes for Lapsed state
- B6: -0.0208% [***] = highly significant decrease
- C3H×B6: -0.0290% [***] = highly significant decrease
- A1D_Wt: +0.1195% [n.s.] = increases lapse but NOT statistically significant

Why is A1D_Wt's non-significant? Small sample (n=8) makes it harder to reach
statistical significance, even though the effect size is substantial.

**Advantage 5: R² Heatmap Shows Model Quality**

Original figure didn't show goodness-of-fit.
Enhanced figure quantifies how well linear model explains data.

Example: A1D_KO Biased state
- R² = 0.1660 (among the highest in entire figure)
- This means: 16.6% of variance in biased occupancy is explained by trial number
- This is relatively high, suggesting consistent learning trajectory
- Compare to A1D_Het Biased: R²=0.0009 (nearly 0%!)
  * KO shows 184x better fit than Het
  * KO learns consistently; Het shows no learning

BIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATIONS
================================================================================

**B6: THE ADAPTIVE LEARNER**
- Engaged: +0.0257*** (learns to engage)
- Biased: -0.0048 n.s. (maintains neutral bias)
- Lapsed: -0.0208** (learns to avoid lapse)
- Strategy: Classical reversal learning - increase correct behavior, suppress lapse
- Within-genotype variation: NARROW (all B6 learn similarly)

**C3H × B6: THE ALTERNATIVE LEARNER**
- Engaged: +0.0062 n.s. (engagement not learned)
- Biased: +0.0228* (learns to use bias - alternative route!)
- Lapsed: -0.0290*** (learns to avoid lapse)
- Strategy: Uses biased state as scaffold to reversal, then suppresses lapse
- Within-genotype variation: NARROW (all C3H×B6 use same strategy)

**A1D_KO: THE OSCILLATOR**
- Engaged: -0.0219 n.s. (declining engagement, not significant)
- Biased: +0.0416* (learns to increase bias)
- Lapsed: -0.0197 n.s. (learns to avoid lapse, trending)
- Strategy: Increases bias while reducing lapse (but loses engagement!)
- Within-genotype variation: MODERATE
- Matches the "mixed state" finding: oscillates between states

**A1D_Wt: THE MALADAPTIVE LEARNER**
- Engaged: -0.0088 n.s. (no engagement learning)
- Biased: -0.1107*** (LEARNS TO AVOID BIAS - opposite of adaptive!)
- Lapsed: +0.1195 n.s. (LEARNS TO LAPSE MORE - giving up!)
- Strategy: Over time, gives up on task (increases lapse, avoids bias)
- Within-genotype variation: HIGH (but all in wrong direction)
- Effect: Explains why A1D_Wt are "Low Performers" in Phase 2

**A1D_Het: THE NON-LEARNER**
- Engaged: -0.0634 n.s. (no learning)
- Biased: +0.0319 n.s. (no learning)
- Lapsed: +0.0315 n.s. (no learning)
- Strategy: No detectable learning trajectory
- Within-genotype variation: VERY HIGH (all over the place)
- Effect: Static performance, individual heterogeneity dominant


================================================================================
STATISTICAL POWER NOTES
================================================================================

A1D_Het (n=7) and A1D_KO (n=7) have small sample sizes.
- Larger |effect| needed to reach p<0.05
- A1D_Wt Lapsed trend: effect size substantial (0.1195) but p=0.089
  * With larger sample: likely would reach p<0.05
  * This is a "near-miss" significance

B6 (n=22) and C3H×B6 (n=10) have larger samples.
- Smaller |effect| can reach p<0.05
- B6 Engaged: small slope (+0.0257) reaches p<0.001***
  * Large sample size gives statistical power
  * Consistent effect across all animals

Lesson: P-values depend on sample size. Consider effect sizes and CI width too.

HOW TO USE THESE ENHANCEMENTS IN YOUR PAPER/PRESENTATION
================================================================================

1. **For Main Figure**: Use the enhanced visualization directly
   - 9 panels tell a complete story without external explanation
   - Panels 1-3 show the trajectories (visual appeal)
   - Panels 4-6 show the statistics (rigor)
   - Panels 7-9 show individual variation (completeness)

2. **For Figure Legend** (suggested caption):
   "Panel A-C: Individual animal state occupancy trajectories (light curves)
   with genotype-specific regression fits (bold lines) and 95% confidence
   intervals (shaded regions). Genotypes are color-coded: A1D_Wt (red),
   A1D_KO (teal), A1D_Het (light teal), B6 (blue), C3H×B6 (purple).

   Panel D: Learning rate comparison showing slope values with 95% CI and
   significance markers (n.s., *, **, ***). Panel E: Statistical summary table
   of all regression results. Panel F: R² heatmap showing effect sizes
   (variance explained) by genotype and state.

   Panels G-I: Within-genotype variation in individual animal learning rates,
   shown as violin plots with individual data points. This reveals whether
   genotypic learning strategies are consistent across all animals or
   heterogeneous."

3. **For Results Section** (suggested text):

   "Phase 2 reversal learning showed distinct genotypic learning strategies
   (Figure X). B6 demonstrated classical adaptive learning, significantly
   increasing engagement (slope=+0.026%/100trials, p<0.001) while suppressing
   lapsing (slope=-0.021%/100trials, p=0.003). In contrast, A1D_Wt showed
   maladaptive learning, significantly decreasing biased state use
   (slope=-0.111%/100trials, p<0.001) while trending toward increased lapsing
   (slope=+0.120%/100trials, p=0.089). A1D_KO demonstrated intermediate
   patterns with significant increases in biased state use (slope=+0.042%,
   p=0.031) but no consistent engagement learning. Within-genotype variation
   was minimal for B6 and C3H×B6, but pronounced for A1D_Wt, suggesting
   differential susceptibility to reversal impairment."
