RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HANDLING POOR PERFORMERS
=============================================

FINDINGS:
---------
See poor_performer_classification.csv for full details.

QUESTIONS TO ADDRESS:
---------------------
1. Are poor performers evenly distributed across genotypes?
   → If YES: Safe to include all animals
   → If NO: Poor performers may bias genotype comparisons

2. Do genotype differences persist after excluding poor performers?
   → If YES: Robust effect, not driven by poor performers
   → If NO: Effect may be driven by a few bad animals

3. What causes poor performance?
   - Data quality issues (missing latencies, recording errors)
   - True behavioral impairment
   - Motivational issues
   - Task difficulty (some animals never learn)

ANALYSIS OPTIONS:
-----------------

Option 1: INCLUDE ALL ANIMALS
  Pros:
  - Maximum sample size
  - No selection bias
  - Represents full genotype range

  Cons:
  - Poor performers may obscure real effects
  - Data quality issues may confound results

Option 2: EXCLUDE POOR PERFORMERS
  Pros:
  - Cleaner signal
  - Focus on animals that learned task
  - Reduces noise from data quality issues

  Cons:
  - Reduced sample size
  - Selection bias
  - May miss important phenotypes

Option 3: STRATIFIED ANALYSIS
  - Report results both ways (all animals + good performers only)
  - Test if genotype effects are consistent across both
  - Most transparent approach

  RECOMMENDED for your analyses

Option 4: CONTROL FOR PERFORMANCE
  - Include overall accuracy as covariate in statistical models
  - Tests if genotype effects persist after accounting for ability
  - Separates "learning impairment" from "strategy differences"

SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOUR DATA:
---------------------------------------

1. For GLM-HMM state analyses:
   → Keep all animals (states may capture poor performance)
   → But mark poor performers in visualizations
   → Test if state distributions differ for good vs poor performers

2. For genotype comparisons:
   → Use stratified analysis (Option 3)
   → Report both including and excluding poor performers
   → Check if conclusions change

3. For manuscript:
   → Clearly define "poor performer" criteria
   → Report n excluded and reasons
   → Show data with and without poor performers in supplement

4. For F-/- genotype specifically:
   → Many have data quality issues (NaN latencies)
   → Consider excluding animals with >50% missing data
   → May need manual review of raw data files

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Review poor_performer_classification.csv
2. Decide on exclusion criteria (if any)
3. Re-run key analyses with/without poor performers
4. Compare results to assess robustness
5. Document decisions and rationale for manuscript
