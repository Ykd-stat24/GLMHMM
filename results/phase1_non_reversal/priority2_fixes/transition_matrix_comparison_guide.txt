TRANSITION MATRIX COMPARISON GUIDE
===================================

WHAT IS A TRANSITION MATRIX?
-----------------------------
A transition matrix shows the probability of switching between behavioral states.

Each cell (i,j) = P(transitioning from state i to state j)

Example:
        To: Engaged  Lapsed  Mixed
  From:
  Engaged    0.85     0.10    0.05    → 85% stay engaged, 10% lapse, 5% mixed
  Lapsed     0.20     0.70    0.10    → 70% stay lapsed, 20% recover to engaged
  Mixed      0.40     0.20    0.40    → 40% stay mixed, 40% to engaged, 20% lapse

INTERPRETING THE MATRIX:
------------------------
1. **Diagonal values (self-transitions)**:
   - High values (>0.7): State is stable, animals tend to stay in state
   - Low values (<0.5): State is transient, animals frequently switch

2. **Off-diagonal values (state switches)**:
   - Large values indicate common transitions
   - Small values indicate rare transitions

3. **Row patterns**:
   - Each row sums to 1.0 (probabilities)
   - Compare rows to understand "exit patterns" from each state

HOW TO COMPARE BETWEEN GENOTYPES:
----------------------------------

1. **Visual Comparison**:
   - Look for differences in color patterns
   - Compare diagonal values (state stability)
   - Check which off-diagonal transitions are prominent

2. **Key Metrics to Compare**:

   a) **State Persistence** (diagonal values):
      - P(Engaged → Engaged): How stable is engaged state?
      - P(Lapsed → Lapsed): Do animals get "stuck" in lapsed state?
      - Higher persistence = more stable states

   b) **Recovery Rate** (Lapsed → Engaged):
      - P(Lapsed → Engaged): How quickly do animals recover?
      - Higher values = better recovery
      - Genotype differences here may indicate resilience

   c) **Lapse Entry** (Engaged → Lapsed):
      - P(Engaged → Lapsed): How often do animals lose focus?
      - Lower values = more stable performance
      - Higher values = more vulnerable to distraction

   d) **Mixed State Dynamics**:
      - P(Mixed → Engaged): Progressing toward expertise?
      - P(Mixed → Lapsed): Falling into disengagement?

3. **Statistical Comparison**:

   For each cell (i,j), compare genotypes:
   - Compute mean transition probability across animals
   - Compute standard deviation (shown as ± values)
   - Larger SD = more heterogeneity within genotype

   Example comparison:
   - Genotype +/+: P(Engaged → Engaged) = 0.85 ± 0.05
   - Genotype -/-: P(Engaged → Engaged) = 0.70 ± 0.12

   Interpretation:
   - +/+ animals have more stable engaged state
   - -/- animals have more variable performance

4. **Patterns to Look For**:

   a) **"Sticky" states**:
      - One state has very high self-transition (>0.9)
      - Suggests animals get "trapped" in that state

   b) **Cyclic patterns**:
      - Strong A→B and B→A transitions
      - Suggests oscillation between states

   c) **Unidirectional flow**:
      - Strong A→B but weak B→A
      - Suggests learning progression or deterioration

   d) **Random switching**:
      - All off-diagonal values similar (~1/3 for 3 states)
      - Suggests no structured state dynamics

EXAMPLE INTERPRETATIONS:
------------------------

**High-Performing Genotype:**
  - High P(Engaged → Engaged): 0.85+ (stable performance)
  - Low P(Engaged → Lapsed): <0.10 (resistant to distraction)
  - High P(Lapsed → Engaged): >0.30 (quick recovery)
  - P(Lapsed → Lapsed): <0.60 (don't get stuck)

**Impaired Genotype:**
  - Lower P(Engaged → Engaged): 0.60-0.70 (less stable)
  - Higher P(Engaged → Lapsed): 0.20-0.30 (more distractible)
  - Lower P(Lapsed → Engaged): <0.20 (slow recovery)
  - Higher P(Lapsed → Lapsed): >0.70 (stuck in lapse)

STATISTICAL TESTS:
------------------
To formally test genotype differences:

1. **Cell-by-cell t-tests**:
   - For each transition (i→j), compare genotypes
   - Correct for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni or FDR)

2. **Matrix distance metrics**:
   - Frobenius norm: ||Matrix1 - Matrix2||
   - Measures overall similarity
   - Can use permutation tests for significance

3. **Key transition comparisons**:
   - Focus on theoretically important transitions
   - Reduces multiple comparison burden
   - e.g., only test recovery and lapse entry rates

COHORT-SPECIFIC NOTES:
----------------------

Your data shows:
  - Cohort W: Generally well-defined states
  - Cohort F: Some genotypes have "Undefined" states
    → May have less clear state structure
    → Transitions harder to interpret

For genotypes with undefined states:
  - Transitions may not have clear behavioral meaning
  - Consider whether 3-state model is appropriate
  - May need to focus on defined states only

RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------
1. Create a table comparing key transitions across genotypes
2. Focus on biologically meaningful transitions
3. Report both mean and variability (SD)
4. Consider effect sizes, not just statistical significance
5. Relate transition patterns to behavioral outcomes
