RESPONSE TIME CALCULATION AND KS TEST INTERPRETATION
=====================================================

RESPONSE TIME (RT) CALCULATION:
-------------------------------
RT = response_latency field from raw data

From Bussey touchscreen system:
  • RT = Time from stimulus onset to first touch response
  • Units: seconds
  • Typically ranges from 0.5s to 5s for mice
  • Excludes: reward collection time, ITI, correction trials

Data processing:
  1. Load raw 'Response Latency' from touchscreen data
  2. Convert to numeric (handles missing/invalid values)
  3. Remove outliers (> 99th percentile)
  4. No transformation applied (use raw RT in seconds)

KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV (KS) TEST:
------------------------------
Tests whether two samples come from the same distribution.

Test statistic (D):
  • D = max vertical distance between CDFs
  • Range: 0 to 1
  • Larger D = more different distributions

P-value interpretation:
  • p < 0.05: Distributions are statistically different
  • p ≥ 0.05: Cannot reject null (distributions may be same)

WHY KS TESTS SEEM "TOO LIBERAL":
--------------------------------

PROBLEM: Small visual differences in Q-Q plots yield significant p-values.

EXPLANATION:
1. **Large sample sizes**:
   - Engaged: ~10,000+ trials
   - Lapsed: ~3,000+ trials
   - Mixed: ~2,000+ trials

   With large N, even tiny effect sizes become statistically significant!

2. **KS test is VERY sensitive**:
   - Detects small deviations anywhere in distribution
   - Not just mean/variance differences
   - Picks up subtle shape differences

3. **Biological variability**:
   - Real behavioral states DO have slightly different RT distributions
   - Even if visually similar, subtle differences exist

4. **Q-Q plot close to diagonal ≠ same distribution**:
   - Q-Q plots show quantile-quantile correspondence
   - Can be "close" but still statistically different
   - Visual similarity doesn't account for sample size

EXAMPLE: Engaged vs Mixed
-------------------------
  • Q-Q plot: Mostly along diagonal
  • Visual: 95% of points within ±0.2s
  • KS test: D = 0.08, p = 0.001

  Interpretation:
  - Distributions ARE different (p < 0.05)
  - But effect size is SMALL (D = 0.08)
  - With N=10,000 trials, we have power to detect tiny effects

WHAT TO REPORT:
---------------
1. **Effect size (D statistic)**:
   - D < 0.1: Trivial difference (even if p < 0.05)
   - D = 0.1-0.3: Small difference
   - D = 0.3-0.5: Moderate difference
   - D > 0.5: Large difference

2. **Practical significance**:
   - Median RT difference < 200ms: Probably not behaviorally meaningful
   - Median RT difference > 500ms: Likely behaviorally meaningful

3. **Consider both statistics AND plots**:
   - Don't rely on p-values alone
   - Look at Q-Q plots AND KS statistic
   - Report median RT differences

GENOTYPE COMPARISONS (+/- vs -/-):
-----------------------------------
You noted Q-Q plots are very close to diagonal but p < 0.05.

This is EXPECTED because:
  • Similar genotypes → similar RT distributions
  • Large sample sizes → high statistical power
  • Small biological differences become detectable
  • P-value reflects statistical significance, NOT effect size

RECOMMENDATION:
---------------
For manuscript:
  - Report KS D statistic alongside p-value
  - Include median RT and IQR for each group
  - Emphasize effect sizes over p-values
  - Note: "Statistically significant but small effect (D = 0.08)"

For interpretation:
  - Focus on large effects (D > 0.3)
  - Consider biological/behavioral relevance
  - Don't over-interpret small but significant differences
